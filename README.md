# My first portfolio 💪🏻

## Something to have in mind

_One of the 12 Agile Principles_, just made sense to me doing this portfolio, the number "10 Simplicity Essential" which makes me think all time, how difficult is for me with a graphic design background to think simple. I wasted a lot of time doing some "high fidelity". I was thinking that was not enough. But after speaking with some bootcampers, I got what I needed to make this simple.

I don't have the all knowledge right now to do what I dreamed, but in the future, I will come back and do the best one.

> "Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential"
